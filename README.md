## Installation and start-up

To make it easy for you to install project, here's a list of recommended next steps.

1. Clone the project from the Git repository
2. Go to the project directory
3. Check the availability of your ports, in particular
    - port 3000 on which the project (Website Chillo) starts
4. Launch the Docker containers using Docker Compose (the -d option allows you to run in the background):
     ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Start-up preview

To visualise, you can:

1. Visualise on your browser by enter:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000/
   ```

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
